# AEM Local Instance

This repository provides a ready-to-use skeleton for setting up local AEM environments. It includes scripts to configure and run AEM Author and Publish instances in a clean and isolated directory structure.

## üõ†Ô∏è Cloning the Repo by OS and Minimal Download

This repository supports Linux/macOS and Windows scripts in separate branches to avoid downloading unnecessary files.

- **Linux/macOS users:** Clone the `main` branch which contains shell scripts and README with right instructions.
- **Windows users:** Clone the `windows` branch which contains batch scripts (experimental) and README with how to use.

To minimize download size, perform a shallow clone with only the latest commit:

### Linux/macOS

```bash
git clone --branch main --depth 1 https://github.com/lu-ch0/aem-skeleton.git your-instance-folder
cd your-instance-folder
```

### Windows (Git Bash)

```bash
git clone --branch windows --depth 1 https://github.com/lu-ch0/aem-skeleton.git your-instance-folder
cd your-instance-folder
```

## üìÅ Folder Structure

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ init.bat              # Initializes the folder structure and copies the AEM JAR
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ run.bat               # Script to start/stop Author and/or Publish instances
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ author/               # Contains the Author jar
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ publish/              # Contains the Publish jar
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/                 # Stores runtime logs and PIDs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dispatcher/           # Placeholder for dispatcher tools and configs
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Initial Setup

### Windows (Experimental)

1. Download the AEM Quickstart jar from Adobe.
2. Run the `init.bat` script by double-clicking it or from the command line:

```
init.bat
```

3. The script will prompt you to enter the full path to the downloaded JAR.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The Windows scripts are experimental and might have limitations compared to the Linux/macOS versions.

This will:
- Create required folders
- Copy the JAR into both `author/` and `publish/` directories
- Delete the original JAR
- Remove `.git/` to make the setup standalone

---

## üöÄ Usage

### Windows (Experimental)

Double-click `run.bat` to launch a menu-driven interface to start/stop Author, Publish, or both.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The Windows scripts are experimental and might not support all features (e.g., `status` command may be limited).


Logs and PID files are saved under the `logs/` directory.

## üß™ Simulating a Local AEM Runtime Distribution

To simulate a local runtime distribution as done in Adobe Cloud Service, follow Adobe's official instructions:

üëâ [Simulate AEM Runtime Locally (Adobe Docs)](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-learn/cloud-service/local-development-environment-set-up/aem-runtime#content-distribution)

## ‚úÖ TODO

- [ ] Add local Dispatcher configuration templates under `dispatcher/`
- [ ] Include `run.sh` for Dispatcher simulation
- [ ] Add port configurability to `run.sh`
- [ ] Integrate support for `.env` configuration overrides
- [x] Add `status` command to check if instances are running

Feel free to fork this repo or use it as a template for each local AEM instance you need.
